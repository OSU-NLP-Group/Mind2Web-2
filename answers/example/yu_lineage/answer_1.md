# Academic Lineage of Prof. Yu Su

Tracing the doctoral advisor relationships through five generations reveals a fascinating intellectual heritage spanning computer science, data mining, and philosophy. The first three generations are definitively confirmed through multiple authoritative sources, while generations four and five require additional archival research for complete verification.

## Generation 1: Xifeng Yan (Confirmed)

**Prof. Yu Su's doctoral advisor** is **Dr. Xifeng Yan** , Professor of Computer Science at University of California, Santa Barbara.

**Verification Sources:**

- **UCSB Official Announcement (2018)** : "UCSB Computer Science Ph.D. candidate Yu Su recently accepted a faculty position with Ohio State University as Assistant Professor in the Computer Science and Engineering Department beginning Fall 2018. Currently, he is finishing up his Ph.D. with Dr. Xifeng Yan." [1]
- **Academic Database** : Direct citation "PhD Advisor · Xifeng Yan · 2012 – 2018" [2]
- **Publication Record** : Multiple co-authored papers during PhD years (2012-2018) in EMNLP, NAACL, SDM
- **Google Scholar** : Xifeng Yan prominently listed in Yu Su's collaborator network [3]

**Academic Details:**

- PhD completed at UCSB (2012-2018) [1]
- Research focus: Natural language processing, data mining, question answering [1]
- Yu Su received Outstanding Dissertation Award from UCSB Computer Science (2019) [4] [5]

## Generation 2: Jiawei Han (Confirmed)

**Dr. Xifeng Yan's doctoral advisor** is **Dr. Jiawei Han** , Michael Aiken Chair Professor at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

**Verification Sources:**

- **Mathematics Genealogy Project** : Direct citation "Advisor 1: Jiawei Han" for Xifeng Yan (MGP ID: 279264) [6]
- **Academic Profile Database** : "PhD Advisor · Jiawei Han · 2001 – 2006" [7]
- **UIUC Data Mining Group Website** : Consistently refers to Yan as "our group's alumnus" [8]
- **Dissertation Record** : "Mining, Indexing and Similarity Search in Large Graph Data Sets" (2006) [6]

**Academic Details:**

- PhD completed at UIUC (2001-2006) [7] [9]
- **ACM SIGMOD Dissertation Award Honorable Mention** (2007) [10]
- Research conducted within Han's renowned Data Mining Group (DMG) [8]

## Generation 3: Larry E. Travis (Confirmed)

**Dr. Jiawei Han's doctoral advisor** is **Dr. Larry E. Travis** (1929-2017), Professor Emeritus at University of Wisconsin-Madison.

**Verification Sources:**

- **Mathematics Genealogy Project** : "Advisor: Larry Travis" for Jiawei Han (MGP ID: 72247) [11]
- **OpenReview Database** : "PhD Advisor · Larry Travis · 1983 – 1985" [12]
- **Joint Publication (1985)** : Han and Travis co-authored "Using Expert Knowledge in Database-Oriented Problem Solving" [13]
- **Multiple Biographical Sources** : Consistent documentation across academic profiles

**Academic Details:**

- PhD completed at University of Wisconsin-Madison (1985) [14]
- Dissertation: "Pattern-Based and Knowledge-Directed Query Compilation for Recursive Data Bases" [11]
- Travis served as Computer Sciences Department Chair (1978-1980) and Director of Madison Academic Computing Center [15] [16]
- Research focus: Artificial intelligence, expert systems, Prolog [15]

## Generation 4: Richard Montague (Probable - Requires Verification)

**Dr. Larry E. Travis's doctoral advisor** is most likely **Dr. Richard Montague** , but this requires additional archival research for definitive confirmation.

**Current Evidence:**

- **Larry E. Travis PhD Details** : University of California, Los Angeles, Philosophy Department (1966) [16] [17]
- **Dissertation** : "A Logical Analysis of the Concept of Stored Program: A Step Toward a Possible Theory of Rational Learning" [16] [17]
- **Mathematics Genealogy Project** : Lists Travis (MGP ID: 82279) [17] but **does not specify his advisor** [17]

**Most Likely Candidate - Richard Montague:**

- UCLA Philosophy Professor specializing in mathematical logic (1955-1971) [18]
- **Confirmed dissertation supervisor** for other UCLA logic students (Nino Cocchiarella, Hans Kamp) [18]
- Co-founder of UCLA Logic Colloquium with C.C. Chang [19] [20]
- Research specialization aligns with Travis's dissertation on formal logical systems
- Active during Travis's doctoral period (1960s)

**Research Limitations:**

- No online sources definitively name Travis's advisor
- UCLA archival records from 1966 not digitally accessible
- ProQuest dissertation database access needed for full dissertation acknowledgments

## Generation 5: Cannot Be Determined

Without definitive confirmation of Generation 4, Generation 5 cannot be reliably identified. If Richard Montague is confirmed as Travis's advisor, his doctoral advisor would need to be researched (likely at UC Berkeley under Alfred Tarski, based on typical academic patterns of the era).

## Research Quality Assessment

**High Confidence (Generations 1-3):**

- Multiple independent, authoritative sources
- Mathematics Genealogy Project confirmation [21]
- Official university announcements
- Consistent publication and collaboration records

**Medium Confidence (Generation 4):**

- Strong circumstantial evidence pointing to Richard Montague
- Timeline and specialization alignment
- No contradictory evidence found

**Requires Additional Research:**

- UCLA Special Collections and University Archives [22]
- Access to original 1966 dissertation with acknowledgments
- UCLA Philosophy Department historical records
- Contact with Mathematics Genealogy Project to add missing advisor information

## Academic Lineage Summary

1. **Yu Su** → Xifeng Yan (UCSB, 2012-2018) [1] ✓ **Confirmed**
2. **Xifeng Yan** → Jiawei Han (UIUC, 2001-2006) ✓ **Confirmed**
3. **Jiawei Han** → Larry E. Travis (UW-Madison, 1983-1985) ✓ **Confirmed**
4. **Larry E. Travis** → Richard Montague (UCLA, ~1966) ? **Probable**
5. **Richard Montague** → [Unknown] ? **Requires Generation 4 confirmation**

This lineage represents a remarkable intellectual trajectory from early computer science and AI foundations through data mining innovations to modern natural language processing and large language models, spanning over five decades of computational research evolution.
