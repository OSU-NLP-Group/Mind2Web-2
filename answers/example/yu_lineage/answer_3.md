# Prof. Yu Su's Academic Lineage: Five Generations

This research traces the complete doctoral advisor lineage of Prof. Yu Su at The Ohio State University through five generations, revealing a remarkable intellectual heritage spanning computer science, mathematics, and mathematical logic from the early 20th century to today.

**Yu Su's doctoral advisor is Dr. Xifeng Yan (UC Santa Barbara), whose lineage traces back through distinguished figures including data mining pioneer Jiawei Han, AI researcher Larry Travis, famous mathematician Abraham Robinson, and Hungarian function theorist Paul Dienes.** This lineage spans multiple countries, institutions, and mathematical disciplines, representing nearly a century of academic scholarship from Europe to North America.

## Generation 1: Xifeng Yan (UC Santa Barbara)

**Full Name:** Xifeng Yan **PhD Institution:** University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign **Year Completed:** 2006 **Doctoral Advisor:** Jiawei Han **Primary Research Area:** Data mining, graph mining, knowledge bases, and conversational AI

Xifeng Yan serves as Professor and holds the Venkatesh Narayanamurti Chair in Computer Science at UC Santa Barbara. [1] His 2006 dissertation "Mining, Indexing and Similarity Search in Large Graph Data Sets" [2] earned him the **ACM-SIGMOD Dissertation Runner-Up Award** in 2007. [3] [4] He has received numerous accolades including the NSF CAREER Award and IBM Invention Achievement Award, with over 23,000 citations demonstrating his significant impact on data mining research.

## Generation 2: Jiawei Han (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign)

**Full Name:** Jiawei Han **PhD Institution:** University of Wisconsin-Madison **Year Completed:** 1985 [6] **Doctoral Advisor:** Larry E. Travis **Primary Research Area:** Data mining, text mining, database systems, and information networks

Jiawei Han is the Michael Aiken Chair Professor at UIUC and founder of the influential Data Mining Group (DMG). [7] Born in Shanghai in 1949, he completed his bachelor's degree at University of Science and Technology of China in 1979 before pursuing doctoral studies at UW-Madison. [8] His dissertation "Pattern-Based and Knowledge-Directed Query Compilation for Recursive Data Bases" established foundations for intelligent database systems. [9] Han is an **ACM Fellow and IEEE Fellow** , recipient of multiple prestigious awards including the ACM SIGKDD Innovations Award (2004) and IEEE Computer Society W. Wallace McDowell Award (2009). [8] He authored the widely-used textbook "Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques." [8]

## Generation 3: Larry E. Travis (University of Wisconsin-Madison)

**Full Name:** Larry E. Travis **PhD Institution:** University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) **Year Completed:** 1966 **Doctoral Advisor:** Abraham Robinson **Primary Research Area:** Artificial intelligence, expert systems, Prolog programming, and AI applications

Larry Travis (1929-2017) served as Professor Emeritus in the Computer Sciences Department at UW-Madison for 30 years (1964-1994). [10] His 1966 dissertation "A Logical Analysis of the Concept of Stored Program: A Step Toward a Possible Theory of Rational Learning" reflected his philosophical approach to computing. [11] Travis was **Chair of the Computer Sciences Department (1978-1980)** and Director of Madison Academic Computing Center, playing a crucial role in expanding computing across the university system. [12] He pioneered work in expert systems and Prolog programming at UW-Madison. [12]

## Generation 4: Abraham Robinson (UCLA)

**Full Name:** Abraham Robinson (born Abraham Robinsohn) **PhD Institution:** University of London (Birkbeck College) **Year Completed:** 1949 **Doctoral Advisor:** Paul Dienes **Primary Research Area:** Mathematical logic, model theory, and nonstandard analysis

Abraham Robinson (1918-1974) was one of the most influential mathematicians of the 20th century. [13] [14] Born in Germany and later studying at Hebrew University of Jerusalem under Abraham Fraenkel, he completed his PhD in 1949 with dissertation "The Metamathematics of Algebraic Systems." [14] [13] Robinson revolutionized mathematics with his development of **nonstandard analysis** , providing a rigorous foundation for infinitesimals and validating Leibniz's original approach to calculus. [15] He published his groundbreaking book "Non-standard Analysis" in 1966 while at UCLA (1962-1967). [14] [16] **Robinson was elected to the National Academy of Sciences** shortly before his death and received the Brouwer Medal from the Dutch Mathematical Society (1973). His work spans 130 papers and 9 books, [15] with the Mathematics Genealogy Project documenting 19 direct students and 537 academic descendants. [17] [18]

## Generation 5: Paul Dienes (University of London)

**Full Name:** Paul Alexander Dienes (Hungarian: Dienes Pál) **PhD Institution:** Eötvös Loránd University and Université Paris IV-Sorbonne **Year Completed:** 1905 (Budapest), 1907 (Paris) **Doctoral Advisor:** Not definitively documented in available sources **Primary Research Area:** Function theory, mathematical analysis, and Taylor series

Paul Dienes (1882-1952) was a Hungarian mathematician who fled political persecution in 1920 and became Professor of Mathematics at Birkbeck College, London (1923-1948). [19] Born in Tokaj, Austria-Hungary, he earned dual PhDs with his dissertation "Essai sur les Singularités des Fonctions Analytiques." [20] [21] Dienes is best known for his work "The Taylor Series" (1931) [19] and for supervising several distinguished mathematicians including Abraham Robinson and Ralph Henstock. [19] [22] His academic career bridged the classical European mathematical tradition with the emerging modern mathematical landscape of the mid-20th century.

## Research Methodology and Source Verification

This lineage was traced using multiple authoritative sources including the Mathematics Genealogy Project, university archives, official faculty records, academic databases, and biographical sources. [18] Each advisor-student relationship was verified through multiple independent sources, including official university announcements, [24] dissertation records, academic profiles, and peer-reviewed publications. The research revealed some gaps in computer science coverage in traditional academic genealogy databases, highlighting the importance of interdisciplinary verification across mathematical and computer science sources. [25] [26]

The traced lineage spans remarkable intellectual diversity: from modern AI and data mining (Yu Su, Yan, Han) through early computer science and AI (Travis) to foundational mathematical logic (Robinson) and classical analysis (Dienes), representing nearly a century of mathematical and computational advancement across multiple continents and institutions.
