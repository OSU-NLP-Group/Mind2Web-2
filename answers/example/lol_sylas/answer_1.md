# The Iconic Sylas Play: Faker's World Championship Legacy

Based on extensive research across esports databases, match highlights, and tournament records, **no documented instances exist of the specific scenario described occurring in World Championship finals during the S9-S13 timeframe** . However, the research revealed a remarkably similar and historically significant play that likely matches your query.

## The definitive match: 2024 World Championship Finals Game 4

The most prominent Sylas ultimate steal involving Rakan that secured a World Championship victory occurred at **2024 Worlds Finals Game 4** , where **Lee "Faker" Sang-hyeok** of T1 executed one of the most iconic plays in League of Legends history.

**The game-changing moment occurred at the 20-minute mark** when Faker, playing Sylas on blue side mid lane, positioned strategically near mid-lane and stole Rakan's ultimate "The Quickness" from BLG's support ON. [1] Using the stolen ultimate's movement speed buff combined with Flash and Hextech Rocketbelt, Faker perfectly engaged onto both of BLG's carries (AP and AD), enabling his teammates to follow up with coordinated linear spells that turned the teamfight decisively in T1's favor. [1]

This play was crucial for T1's comeback from facing elimination down 2-1 in the series, ultimately leading to their 3-2 championship victory and Faker's fifth World Championship title. [1]
