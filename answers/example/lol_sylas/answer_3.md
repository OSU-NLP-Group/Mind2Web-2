# The Search for the Legendary Sylas-Rakan Ultimate Steal

After extensive research across multiple World Championship tournaments from S9-S14, **no specific documented play matches exactly the described scenario** of Sylas stealing Rakan's ultimate in World Championship finals to lock down double carries and secure victory. However, several remarkable Sylas ultimate steal moments were discovered that provide valuable context about memorable championship plays.

## Key findings from World Championship research

**Most notable Sylas performances in World Championship finals occurred in 2023 and 2024** , when Faker dominated with the champion. In the 2024 World Championship Finals between T1 and Bilibili Gaming, Faker's Sylas appeared in multiple games of the 3-2 series victory, [1] with Game 4 featuring particularly impactful stolen ultimate usage that helped save T1 from elimination. [1] However, **this involved stolen abilities other than Rakan's ultimate** , and the specific double-carry lockdown scenario was not documented.

The 2023 World Championship Finals saw Faker's Sylas in Game 2 against Weibo Gaming, where he effectively used stolen Maokai ultimates in T1's dominant 3-0 sweep. [2] Again, no Rakan ultimate steals were recorded in this series.

## Alternative legendary Sylas moments discovered

The research revealed **Caps' extraordinary Sylas performance during the 2020 World Championship Quarterfinals** against Gen.G, which featured one of the most clutch ultimate steal sequences in championship history. Playing at less than 2% health, Caps used a stolen Ashe ultimate to engage onto Gen.G's carries, ultimately achieving an 11/0/11 perfect game performance that led to G2's 3-0 sweep. [3]

**Earlier championship tournaments (2019-2022) showed limited Sylas presence in finals matches** , with no confirmed picks in 2019, 2020, 2021, or 2022 finals. This is significant because Sylas was only introduced in early 2019, [4] making his championship meta development a gradual process. [5] [6]

## Analysis of Sylas-Rakan interaction potential

Research into champion mechanics confirms that **Rakan's ultimate "The Quickness" ranks as A-tier for Sylas to steal** , providing both mobility through movement speed and crowd control through charm effects. This combination would theoretically be highly effective for locking down multiple carries, exactly as described in your query. The stolen ability maintains both the movement speed boost and charm effects when used by Sylas, [7] [8] making it particularly potent for team fight initiation. [9] [8]

## Possible explanations for the missing play

Several factors could explain why this specific play wasn't found in the research:

**Documentation gaps** may exist in older tournament coverage, particularly for plays that occurred during intense team fights where multiple abilities were used simultaneously. **Regional broadcast differences** might mean certain highlights were emphasized more in specific regions' coverage. Additionally, the play might have occurred in **semifinals or other elimination matches** rather than the grand finals specifically.

**Memory conflation** is another possibility - the described play might combine elements from multiple memorable Sylas moments across different matches or tournaments, creating a composite memory of an idealized ultimate steal scenario.

## Conclusion

While the exact Sylas-Rakan ultimate steal play you described remains undocumented in available World Championship records, the research reveals rich context about Sylas's evolution as a championship-level pick [4] and the theoretical effectiveness of stealing Rakan's abilities. The closest documented moments involve Faker's clutch Sylas performances in recent finals [10] and Caps' legendary quarterfinals display, both showcasing why stolen ultimates can be game-changing in high-stakes matches. [3]

The specific combination of Sylas stealing Rakan's ultimate to lock down double carries represents exactly the type of play that would become legendary if it occurred, [7] but current documentation suggests this particular sequence may be either undocumented, misremembered, or potentially occurred in a different context than World Championship finals.
