# The Game-Saving Sylas Play That Defined Worlds 2024

The legendary League of Legends play you're referring to occurred during the **2024 World Championship Finals (Season 14)** at The O2 Arena in London on November 2, 2024. **Lee "Faker" Sang-hyeok** of T1 executed what many consider the most impactful individual play in recent World Championship history, using Sylas to steal Rakan's ultimate and secure T1's fifth world title when they were on the brink of elimination.

## The championship-defining moment

**Match Context** : T1 faced Bilibili Gaming (BLG) in Game 4 of the finals, down 2-1 in the series and facing elimination. [3] Faker had blind-picked Sylas mid-lane for the crucial must-win game, while BLG's support ON (Luo Wen-Jun) was playing Rakan. [4]

At approximately the 20-minute mark, with T1 struggling to find their footing, Faker positioned his Sylas strategically to the side of mid-lane during a crucial teamfight. **He used Sylas' Hijack ability to steal Rakan's ultimate "The Quickness"** from ON, then immediately utilized the stolen ability's movement speed and innate charm effect, combined with Flash and Hextech Rocketbelt, to lock down both of BLG's primary damage dealers - their AP and AD carries. [1]

This play allowed the rest of T1 to follow up with their full combination of abilities, eliminating BLG's key damage sources and completely turning the tide of the game. [4] The official LoL Esports broadcast famously declared **"FAKER IS NOT OF THIS EARTH"** as the play unfolded. [1] [4] T1 leveraged this momentum to secure the Chemtech Dragon Soul and ultimately win Game 4, forcing the decisive Game 5 which they won 3-2 to claim the championship. [4]

## Faker's tournament-long Sylas mastery

Throughout the entire 2024 World Championship, **Faker played Sylas in 6 games with a 66.7% win rate** (4 wins, 2 losses), making it his most-played champion of the tournament. His Sylas statistics across all games were:

- **KDA: 2.56** (16 kills, 16 deaths, 25 assists)
- **CS per Game: 245.17** (8.15 CS/min average)
- **Damage per Game: 11,600** (384.1 DPM)
- **Kill Participation: 61.2%**
- **Kill Share: 23.9%**

Sylas represented **6 out of Faker's 17 total games** (35% of his champion picks), demonstrating both his confidence in the champion and its strategic importance to T1's championship run. [5] Despite not leading statistical categories among mid-laners, Faker's impact through clutch playmaking was immeasurable. [6]

## Tournament significance and legacy

This play occurred during T1's remarkable championship run where they entered as the 4th seed from LCK - the lowest possible seed. Having nearly missed Worlds qualification entirely, the team completed one of the most impressive underdog stories in esports history. [4] **Faker was named Finals MVP** (his second Finals MVP award, first since 2016) [4] and secured his historic **500th kill at Worlds** during this same Game 4. [7]

The Sylas pick became increasingly prioritized throughout the tournament, with opponents frequently banning it against T1 in later stages. The champion perfectly suited Faker's playmaking style and became instrumental in T1 becoming the **first roster to win back-to-back World Championships** . [8]

[6] While his overall Sylas statistics were solid but not spectacular, the contextual impact of this single play - executed when elimination loomed - directly enabled T1's fifth World Championship [7] and cemented Faker's legacy as the greatest League of Legends player of all time.
