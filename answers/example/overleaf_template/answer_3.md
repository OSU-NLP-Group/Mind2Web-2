# Three Overleaf CV Templates with Photo Support

After searching Overleaf's official template gallery, I found several CV templates with built-in photo functionality. However, **most professional CV templates position photos on the left sidebar rather than specifically in the "top left corner"** as requested. Here are the three best templates that support photo display with left-side positioning:

## Template findings and important clarification

**Critical Note** : The specific requirement for photos in the "top left corner" is rarely implemented in professional CV templates, as most use left sidebar layouts where photos are positioned vertically along the left side. The templates below offer the closest match to your requirements with left-side photo placement.

## 1. AltaCV Template

**Status** : Available on Overleaf's template gallery **Photo Functionality** : Built-in left-side photo support with `\photoL{2cm}{photo}` command [1] **Direct Link** : Search "AltaCV" in Overleaf's template gallery or access through the CV/Resume section **Photo Position** : Left side of document, can be positioned at top of left column **Key Features** :

- Supports both circular and rectangular photos with `normalphoto` option [2]
- Multiple photo placement options ( `\photoL` for left, `\photoR` for right) [2]
- Based on Marissa Mayer's CV design [1]
- No customization required for photo display

## 2. Twenty Seconds CV Template

**Status** : Available on Overleaf's template gallery **Photo Functionality** : Built-in circular photo display in left sidebar **Direct Link** : Search "Twenty Seconds CV" or "TwentySecondsCurriculumVitae" in Overleaf's gallery **Photo Position** : Left sidebar, positioned at top of sidebar section **Key Features** :

## 3. Forty Seconds CV Template

- `profilepicsize` , `profilepicstyle` , and positioning options [4]
- Multiple photo styles (circular, square)
- Highly customizable layout
- Based on Twenty Seconds CV but with enhanced features [4]

## How to access these templates

Since Overleaf's template gallery uses dynamic URLs, the most reliable way to access these templates is:

1. Go to **overleaf.com** [5] [6]
2. Click on **"Templates"** in the top menu
3. Filter by **"CV/Resume"** or search for the specific template names: [5] [7] - "AltaCV" - "Twenty Seconds CV" - "Forty Seconds CV"

## Important considerations

**Layout Reality** : Professional CV templates typically use **left sidebar layouts** rather than placing photos in the absolute "top left corner" of the page. [8] The templates above position photos in the **top portion of the left sidebar** , which is the closest professional equivalent to your specification.

**Recommendation** : The **AltaCV template** is your best option as it offers the most flexible photo positioning with the `\photoL` command and explicitly supports left-side photo placement without requiring modifications.

All three templates support photo display without customization and are available in Overleaf's official template gallery, [5] [7] though none place photos in the literal "top left corner" as this isn't a standard professional CV layout pattern.
