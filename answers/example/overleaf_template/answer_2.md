# Overleaf CV Templates with Top-Left Photo Support

I found information about CV/resume templates from Overleaf's official template gallery that can display a photo in the top left corner without requiring further customization. However, I need to report some limitations in obtaining the exact direct URLs you requested.

## Successfully Located Template with Direct URL:

### 1. ModernCV and Cover Letter Template

**Direct URL** : [1]

**Photo Support** : ✅ **Confirmed** - This template includes explicit photo support using the `\photo[64pt][0.4pt]{picture}` command. [2] The photo appears in the top-left area of the CV with customizable dimensions and frame styling. This is an official Overleaf template [2] [1] that requires only replacing the image filename to add your photo. [1]

## Templates Confirmed to Exist with Photo Support (URLs Not Directly Accessible):

### 2. AltaCV Template

**Template Type** : Multiple AltaCV template variations available in Overleaf's official gallery [3] **Photo Support** : ✅ **Confirmed** - The AltaCV class supports photos with options like `\documentclass[10pt,a4paper,normalphoto]{altacv}` for square photos and default circular photo cropping. [4] [5] Photos can be placed in the left sidebar/header area using commands like `\photoL{2.5cm}{photo_name}` . [3]

### 3. Simple Academic CV Template

**Template Type** : Academic CV template with image support [6] **Photo Support** : ✅ **Confirmed** - Templates in this category include photo/image capabilities using commands like `\headerbox{2.6cm}{blackgray}{white}{Captain}{photo.jpg}` for placing photos in the header area. [7] [8]

## Research Limitations:

While I confirmed these templates exist in Overleaf's official collection with the requested photo functionality, I encountered limitations in extracting the exact direct URLs for the AltaCV and Simple Academic CV templates. The search results showed template content and descriptions but didn't always display the complete URL patterns in the required " [9] ]" format.

## Recommendation:

For the two templates without direct URLs, I recommend:

1. Visit Overleaf's template gallery at overleaf.com/gallery/tagged/cv [10]
2. Search for "AltaCV" and "Simple Academic CV"
3. Look for templates that specifically mention photo support in their descriptions

All three template types are confirmed to be from Overleaf's official collection and include built-in photo functionality that works without additional LaTeX customization - requiring only image filename replacement. [10]
