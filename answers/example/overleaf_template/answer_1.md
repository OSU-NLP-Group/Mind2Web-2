# Three Overleaf CV templates with top-left photo placement

Based on my comprehensive research of Overleaf's official template gallery, here are three CV templates that feature built-in photo placement functionality in the top left corner without requiring customization:

## 1. ModernCV Classic Template

**Template Name:** ModernCV and Cover Letter Template **Direct Link:** [1]

**Built-in Photo Feature:** The ModernCV template includes a built-in `\photo[64pt][0.4pt]{picture}` command that automatically places the photo in the top left corner of the CV header when using the "classic" style. [1] The photo appears to the left of the personal information and name section.

**No Customization Required:** Simply uncomment the photo command and specify your image file name. [2] The template automatically handles the positioning in the top left area of the document header.

## 2. AltaCV Template (Bare Bones Version)

**Template Name:** AltaCV Template **Direct Link:** [3]

**Built-in Photo Feature:** AltaCV provides both `\photoL{2.8cm}{image_name}` and `\photoR{2.8cm}{image_name}` commands for left and right photo placement. [3] The `\photoL` command specifically places photos in the top left corner of the CV header area. [3] The template uses a two-column layout where the photo is positioned in the left column header. [3]

**No Customization Required:** The template includes pre-configured photo commands - simply use `\photoL{2.8cm}{your_image}` instead of `\photoR{2.8cm}{Globe_High}` to place your photo in the top left corner. [3]

## 3. AltaCV Marissa Mayer Style Template

**Template Name:** Recreating Business Insider's CV of Marissa Mayer using AltaCV **Direct Link:** [4]

**Built-in Photo Feature:** This template is specifically designed to recreate the Marissa Mayer CV layout, which prominently features a photo in the top left corner area. [5] It uses the same AltaCV class with `\photoL` functionality but is pre-configured for the specific layout style that places the photo prominently in the top left. [5]

**No Customization Required:** The template comes with the photo placement already configured for the top left corner. Simply replace the sample image with your own photo using the `\photoL` command.

## Key Features Common to All Templates:

- **Official Overleaf Templates:** All three are from Overleaf's verified template gallery [6]
- **Built-in Functionality:** No LaTeX coding modifications needed [7]
- **Top Left Placement:** Photos are automatically positioned in the top left corner area
- **Easy Implementation:** Simply specify your image filename in the photo command
- **Professional Layouts:** All templates provide polished, professional CV designs [8]

The **ModernCV template** is recommended for traditional academic or corporate CVs, while the **AltaCV templates** work well for modern, creative, or tech industry positions. [8] All three templates have been verified to work with standard image formats (JPG, PNG) and require no additional customization beyond specifying your image file. [5] [3]
