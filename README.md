## üì• Submission Guideline

To get answers for tasks of Mind2Web 2:
- If you are developing and testing a base model and have no agent framework at hand, you may start from go-to frameworks such as [Hugging Face's Open Deep Research](). You may want to do some zero-shot or few-shot prompting to let the agent better understand how to provide citations, to pass our attribution verifications in the task evaluations.
- If you have your own agent, still notice that we expect the agent to also provide **URL sources** to the critical facts included in the answers. You may also refer to the evaluation script to understand how the evaluation is conducted.

To evaluate answers from an agent system, there are mainly three steps involved: 
1. Collecting answers from your agent on our [private test set](https://huggingface.co/datasets/osunlp/Mind2Web-2/viewer/default/private_test_set)
2. Cache the webpages mentioned in the answers (to ensure consistency and reproducibility), where we provide the script in [Precache Webpage](#3-precache-webpages-optional-but-recommended)
3. Run the evaluation.
4. (Optionally) We also encourage submitting the avg. time and answer lengths to better understand how the agent works.

For the submission, you can either:
- (Recommended) submit your agent's answers as well as providing the webpage cache to us. This ensures the best consistency between the inference and evaluation. We will handle the evaluation cost for you.
- (Recommended) run the whole evaluation by following the instructions in the next section and submit the evaluation results to us.
- Only provide your agent answers and let us handle the webpage caching and evaluation for you

If you choose to submit your agent's answer, please arrange your agent's responses in the following directory structure (see [answers/examples](https://github.com/OSU-NLP-Group/Mind2Web-2/tree/main/answers/example) for reference):

   ```
   <agent_name>
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ <task_id>
   ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ answer_1.md
   ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ answer_2.md
   ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
   ```

Similarly, the according cache structure should be cache/<agent_name>/<task_id>/

Compress the directories and send it to us via email: m2w2-leaderboard@googlegroups.com.

> **Note:**

> If you would like to **explore our tasks and run the evaluation locally**, please refer to the sections below for environment setup and evaluation instructions.


## üöÄ Run Evaluation Locally Yourself

### 0. Environment Setup

#### Option 1: Using uv (Recommended)

If you have [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) installed, it provides faster dependency resolution and installation:

```bash
# Automatically create virtual environment and install all dependencies
uv sync

# Activate the virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install browsers for Playwright
playwright install
```

#### Option 2: Using conda + pip

```bash
# Create and activate conda environment
conda create -n mind2web2 python=3.11
conda activate mind2web2

# Install the package in development mode
pip install -e .

# Install browsers for Playwright
#playwright install
rebrowser_playwright install
```

### 1. Prepare Your Data

Organize your agent's responses in the following directory structure:

```
answers/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ <your_agent_name>/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ <task_id>/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ answer_1.md
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ answer_2.md
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

Each answer file should contain your agent's response in markdown format.

### 2. Set up API Keys

Configure the necessary API keys for evaluation:

```bash
# Set up environment variables for OpenAI API
export OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_OPENAI_KEY"

# (Optional) Environment variables for Azure OpenAI
export AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY"
export AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT_URL="YOUR_AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT_URL"
export AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION="2025-03-01-preview"

# (Optional, but necessary for several tasks) Tool APIs for tasks that require google map APIs
export GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY="YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY"
```

### 3. Precache Webpages (Optional but Recommended)

*Note: This step is not required but highly recommended for reducing evaluation latency, as fetching webpages on-the-fly during evaluation can be very slow.*

Before running evaluation, you may want to precache the webpages to improve performance:

```bash
./cache_all_answers.sh
```

We also provide a lightweight app to fix errors in precached webpages (e.g., pages blocked by human verification):

```bash
# Start the Cache Manager GUI
python run_cache_manager.py

# Optionally load a cache folder on startup (recommended)
python run_cache_manager.py cache/<your_agent_name>

# Debug:
python run_cache_manager.py --log-level DEBUG

```

Notes:
- The Cache Manager is a PySide6 (Qt) desktop app located under `cache_manager/`.
- It helps you inspect, fix, and update cached URLs for each task:
  - Open a cache folder via File ‚Üí ‚ÄúOpen Cache Folder‚Ä¶‚Äù and select `cache/<agent_name>`.
  - Select a task (left), then a URL to preview its cached text/screenshot.
  - Use "Live" view to reload the page, and click ‚ÄúUpdate Cache‚Äù to capture fresh content and overwrite the cache.
  - Use "Upload MHTML" to manually upload a saved MHTML file for the selected URL.

### 4. Run Evaluation

Execute the evaluation using the `run_eval.py` script:

#### Basic Usage

```bash
# Evaluate all tasks for a specific agent
python run_eval.py --agent_name <your_agent_name>

# Evaluate a specific task
python run_eval.py --agent_name <your_agent_name> --task_id <task_id>
```

for example:

```bash
python run_eval.py --agent_name example

python run_eval.py --agent_name example --task_id yu_lineage
```

#### Advanced Configuration

- `--agent_name`: Name of your agent (required)
- `--answer_folder`: Path to directory containing answer files (default: `answers/`)
- `--eval_scripts_root`: Root directory for evaluation scripts (default: `eval_scripts/`)
- `--eval_results_root`: Root directory to save evaluation results (default: `eval_results/`)
- `--cache_root`: Root directory for caching webpages (default: `cache/`)
- `--eval_version`: Version of evaluation scripts to use (default: `2025_07_14`)
- `--task_id`: Specific task to evaluate (optional, evaluates all tasks if not provided)
- `--llm_provider`: LLM provider (`openai` or `azure_openai`, default: `openai`)
- `--max_concurrent_tasks`: Maximum concurrent task evaluations (default: 2)
- `--max_concurrent_answers`: Maximum concurrent answer evaluations per task (default: 3)
- `--max_webpage_retrieval`: Maximum concurrent webpage retrievals (default: 5)
- `--max_llm_requests`: Maximum concurrent LLM API requests (default: 30)
