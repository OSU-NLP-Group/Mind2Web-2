llm_extraction_prompts = """You are responsible for extracting all unique website URLs appearing in the text provided by users.

GENERAL RULES:
1. **Do not** create, omit, or invent any URL. Extract only unique URLs mentioned in the provided text.
2. If no URL exists, return `null` (JSON value).
3. Always include full URLs with protocol. If protocol is missing, prepend `http://`.
4. Ignore obviously invalid or malformed URLs.

SPECIAL ATTENTION - Look for these hard-to-find URLs:
- Domain names without http/https protocol (e.g., "example.com", "www.site.org")
- URLs embedded in prose text without clear formatting
- Partial URLs that need protocol completion
- URLs in quotes, parentheses, or other punctuation
- URLs that may be split across lines or have unusual formatting
